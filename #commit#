Began modification of stand info in light of iteration meeting #2

- Still very much a work in progress; just wanted to commit before heading to class!
- Added temperature slider, instead of text input.
- Added weather picker, instead of text input.

TODO:
- Make the layout look not bad.
- Add date picker, in lieu of text input.
- Have temperature updated via slider
